INPUT FILE:
The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero films, independently 
produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in American 
comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise has expanded to include comic books, 
short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established 
by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, 
and characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character to appear across 
all the different media of the MCU.
